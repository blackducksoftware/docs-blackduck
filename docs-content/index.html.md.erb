This documentation describes the Black Duck Hub Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The Black Duck Hub Service 
Broker for PCF enables developers to secure and manage open source software in PCF apps through the Black Duck Hub console.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Black Duck is the industry leader in open source security and management.  The Black Duck Hub Service Broker for PCF
registers with PCF and exposes its scan service on the Marketplace. Developers can then use Apps Manager or the 
Cloud Foundry command line interface (cf CLI) to bind the Black Duck Hub scan service to their apps.

Creating a Black Duck Hub PCF service instance and binding it to an app enables developers to initiate an open source software 
scan during the cf-push process.
